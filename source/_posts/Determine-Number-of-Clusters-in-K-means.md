K-Means: have k clusters, first randomly choose k centroids, then include to each cluster by smallest distance, calculate the mean of the points in each cluster as the new centroid.

**How will you define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?**

**Why important?** Clustering, a technique used to group together objects with similar characteristics.

<u>Clustering algorithms</u> are the methods that group these data points into different clusters based on their similarities.
