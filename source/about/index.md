<i>**Xinyu(Xiyah) Chang** (She/Her)</i>

An aspiring data scientist pursuing M.S.E. in Data Science at Johns Hopkins. With a strong academic background in Economics, Mathematics, and Data Science from the University of Washington, I've developed skills in machine learning, data visualization, AI, and NLP. Proficient in Java, Python, SQL, R. I'm fluent in English and a native Chinese speaker. I'm eager to collaborate on boundary-pushing data science projects and research. Beyond the academic and professional realm, I'm a dedicated volunteer and leader, having served in various capacities before.

<i>Welcom to explore more about me for my <a href="https://xiyahc.github.io/UndergradUW/">Bachelor's</a> and <a href="https://xiyahc.github.io/GradJHU/">Master's</a> school-life through my timelines.</i>

My **research interests**: As a gamer outside of school, I would like to explore applications of large language models (LLMs) or any NLP techniques in Gaming Industry. Include but not limit to:

- Game Localization
- Ethics problems in games
- Text-to-image models for generating character designs, using retrieval to ensure historically accurate elements
- Models fine-tuning to build better NPC conversations with users.

Video games I played (include bot not limit to):

- Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, Valorant, CSGO 2, Battlefield 5
- League of Legends
- Genshin Impact
- Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Europa Universalis IV, Red Dead Redemption 2

<tr><td><b>Music Emotion Recognition Using Neural Networks</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/XiyahC/MusicEmotionRec">Project Code</a></td><td align="right" style="color: #DE9E48;">January 2024 – May 2024</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

- Led the enhancement of music recognition systems by processing 900 thrity-second audio clips into feature vectors using Python and Librosa, and augmented the dataset to 3,600 samples through noise addition, pitch changing, and time shifting.
<br>

- Developed and compared advanced machine learning models including RNN, BRNN, and LSTM against traditional methods such as Logistic Regresssion and One-vs-Rest Classification to classify music emotions effectively.
<br>

- Applied 5-fold cross-validation and early stopping on the augmented data to optimize model training, resulting in a substantial increase in test accuracy by 20%-30% over the experiment run on the original 900 samples.
<br>

- Conducted further experiment with a 14,000-sample dataset, demonstrating the potential for more complex models to achieve higher classfication accuracy, advocating for the exploration of deeper neural networks.
