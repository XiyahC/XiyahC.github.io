# Bio

An aspiring data scientist pursuing M.S.E. in Data Science at Johns Hopkins. With a strong academic background in Economics, Mathematics, and Data Science from the University of Washington, I've developed skills in machine learning, data visualization, AI, and NLP. Proficient in Java, Python, SQL, R. I'm fluent in English and a native Chinese speaker. I'm eager to collaborate on boundary-pushing data science projects and research. Beyond the academic and professional realm, I'm a dedicated volunteer and leader, having served in various capacities before.

<i>Welcom to explore more about me for my <a href="https://xiyahc.github.io/UndergradUW/">Bachelor's</a> and <a href="https://xiyahc.github.io/GradJHU/">Master's</a> school-life through my timelines.</i>

My **research interests**: 

- Multilingual, 
- Multi-modal LLMs
- Safety and reliability of AI
- Data-to-text generation.

My research works see [these](https://xiyahc.github.io/Research/) pages for details.

---

As a gamer outside of school, I would like to explore applications of large language models (LLMs) or any NLP techniques in Gaming Industry. Include but not limit to:

- Game Localization
- Ethics problems in games
- Text-to-image models for generating character designs, using retrieval to ensure historically accurate elements
- Models fine-tuning to build better NPC conversations with users.

Video games I played (include bot not limit to):

- Overwatch 2, Apex Legends, Valorant, CSGO 2, Battlefield 5
- League of Legends
- Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves
- Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Europa Universalis IV, Red Dead Redemption 2
- Terraria, The Legend of Zelda

<!-- timeline May -->
Multilingual Evidence Against Hallucinations
- Professor: *Philipp Koehn* @ JHU
- Type: Summer Research
- Brief: The issue we want to solve and improve based on current techniques is about retrieve resources from different languages from the given query in a QA system. We proposed a method using Retrieval Augmented Generation systems combining Meta's [Laser encoding](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER) with [Llama3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) Large Langauge Models to train on [MegaWika](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hltcoe/megawika) Dataset where they have QA generated based on multilingual Wikipedia and their reference articles organized in English.
- Specific Updates: [Notes](https://peppered-lily-fd7.notion.site/Multilingual-Evidence-Against-Hallucinations-3b41c7dbf4d3490c8a76c06d756bd677)

MambaDiff: Seq2Seq Models with Diffusion Model and Mabma Architectures
- Instructor: *Daniel Khashabi* @ JHU
- Type: Course Project
- Course: EN.601.671 Natural Language Processing: Self-Supervised Models
- Brief: We are interested in the performance of the newly published [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) Architectures which apply the idea of Selected State Space Models, whether the performance will be good if we combine it to the Diffusion models, which usually used for visual tasks, apply to language tasks.
- Specific Updates: [Notes](https://peppered-lily-fd7.notion.site/MambaDiff-Seq2Seq-Models-with-Diffusion-Model-and-Mabma-Architectures-6c42bfa0588e4bb9964f0a92373bc765?pvs=4)

Music Emotion Recognition Using RNNs
- Instructor: *Anthony, Kearsley* @ JHU
- Type: Course Project
- Course: EN.553.602 Research and Design in Applied Mathematics: Data Mining
- Brief: Do you know there is a Russell's Emotion Quadrant which you can locate various emotions into a 2-d quadrant where the x-axis presents levels of Valence, the y-axis presents levels of Arousals. Through this research project, we handled problems with our limited dataset(900 30-sec audio clips), limited resources(google colab's coding space), and model-selections. [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) is the package we choose to embed the audio clips.

Model Selection for Online Course Participation
- Instructor: *Pemi Nguyen* @ UW
- Type: Course Project
- Course: STAT/CSE 416 Intro. Machine Learning
- Brief: The goal for us is to utilize at least three different kind of Machine Learning models to predict the status of students' online course completions: to predict based on given students' course participation information and some demographic information to know whether they can complete the course and get the certification. We used Neural Networks, K-Nearest neighbors, and Random Forest to predict.

<!-- timeline October -->
Vaccine Schedular Database
- Instructor: *Ryan Maas* @ UW
- Type: Course Project
- Course: CSE 414 Database Systems
- Brief: This is a cool project allowing us to implement a backend for vaccine schedular using python combined with SQL commands, connecting to Microsoft Azure server.
- Specific Updates: [Notes](https://peppered-lily-fd7.notion.site/Vaccine-Schedular-Database-b016922bcd1845378a6a160a28835ba7?pvs=4)
